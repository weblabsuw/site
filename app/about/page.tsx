        WebLabs is highly community-driven.
        If you like to get involved, you can totally do so as a community memberâ€”run your own workshops, propose your own events, and be a positive presence in our community.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Officers, however, hold roles that are more involved and essential to the operations of the club.
        They commit to being there when they're needed, but other than that, they're no different than community members.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        This means the best organizers are usually active community members, so if you're interested, we highly encourage you to be active at our events.
        Keep an eye out for when applications open!
      </p>
